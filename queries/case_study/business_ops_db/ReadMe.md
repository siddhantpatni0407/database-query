# Business Operations Database

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the `business_ops_db` database schema, including its tables, relationships, and commonly used SQL queries for analysis and reporting.

## Database Schema
The `business_ops_db` database consists of multiple tables managing employees, sales, products, orders, customers, and user logins.

## Tables

### **1. employees**
Stores employee details.
- `employee_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `department_id`
- `salary`
- `hire_date`

### **2. sales**
Records sales transactions.
- `sale_id` (Primary Key)
- `employee_id` (Foreign Key -> employees.employee_id)
- `sale_amount`
- `sale_date`

### **3. departments**
Stores department details.
- `department_id` (Primary Key)
- `department_name`

### **4. products**
Contains product information.
- `product_id` (Primary Key)
- `product_name`
- `category`

### **5. orders**
Stores customer orders.
- `order_id` (Primary Key)
- `customer_id`
- `order_date`

### **6. order_items**
Represents items in an order.
- `order_item_id` (Primary Key)
- `order_id` (Foreign Key -> orders.order_id)
- `product_id` (Foreign Key -> products.product_id)
- `quantity`
- `price`

### **7. customers**
Stores customer details.
- `customer_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `registration_date`

### **8. user_logins**
Tracks customer login activity.
- `login_id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key -> customers.customer_id)
- `login_date`

## SQL Queries

### **Medium Level Queries**
1. Find the second highest salary in an employee table.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

2. Fetch all employees whose names contain the letter "a" exactly twice.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name ~* '^([^a]*a[^a]*){2}[^a]*$';
```

3. Retrieve only duplicate records from a table.
```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

4. Calculate the running total of sales by date.
```sql
SELECT sale_date, sale_amount, SUM(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total FROM sales;
```

5. Find employees who earn more than the average salary in their department.
```sql
SELECT e.* FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees GROUP BY department_id
) dept_avg ON e.department_id = dept_avg.department_id
WHERE e.salary > dept_avg.avg_salary;
```

### **Challenging Queries**
1. Retrieve customers who made their first purchase in the last 6 months.
```sql
SELECT c.* FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 months'
ORDER BY o.order_date ASC;
```

2. Calculate the percentage change in sales month-over-month.
```sql
SELECT sale_date, sale_amount,
  (sale_amount - LAG(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date)) / LAG(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) * 100 AS percent_change
FROM sales;
```

3. Fetch all users who logged in consecutively for 3 days or more.
```sql
SELECT user_id FROM (
    SELECT user_id, login_date,
           LEAD(login_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date) AS next_login,
           LEAD(login_date, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date) AS third_login
    FROM user_logins
) consecutive
WHERE next_login = login_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
AND third_login = login_date + INTERVAL '2 days';
```

### **Advanced Queries**
1. Fetch all employees whose salaries fall within the top 10% of their department.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees e
WHERE salary >= (
    SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary) FROM employees e2
    WHERE e.department_id = e2.department_id
);
```

2. Identify orders placed during business hours (9 AM to 6 PM).
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_date) BETWEEN 9 AND 18;
```

3. Retrieve customers who made purchases across at least three different categories.
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.category) >= 3;
```
