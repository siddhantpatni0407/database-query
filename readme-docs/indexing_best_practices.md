## Indexing Best Practices

### Why Indexing Matters
Indexing helps speed up data retrieval in SQL databases by allowing the database engine to find records faster.

### Best Practices
- Use **primary keys** and **unique constraints** where necessary.
- Avoid over-indexing, as it can slow down insert/update operations.
- Use **covering indexes** for frequently used queries.
- Optimize **composite indexes** based on query patterns.
- Regularly **analyze and rebuild** indexes to maintain performance.
